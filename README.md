# Planet Defense
Planet Defense is a simple action game for wave based survival game fans. How long can you survive and protect your planet before you are over-run with enemy's wanting to land and invade the planet? Can you make it long enough to upgrade your ship? Buy perks to improve your chances of surviving so you can defend your planet. It is an OpenGL ES 2.0 application. In fact the whole thing is OpenGL apart from the message boxes which are of course native gui items. It was built as I was getting into Android development for the first time and to this day I am still quite proud of it as I only have a year of programming expierence when I built this application.
