Planet Defense is a simple action game for wave based survival game fans written in Java which the help of OpenGL ES 2.0. In fact, the whole thing is OpenGL apart from the message boxes which are of course native GUI items. It was built as I was getting into Android development for the first time and to this day I am still quite proud of it as I only have a year of programming experience when I built this application.

## Overview

The application was built with Java and the Android-SDK using the OpenGL ES 2.0 bindings that are available in Android devices above 2.3.3 (Gingerbread). This meant writing custom shaders for rendering objects and particles. The artwork was built by a friend in the USA who did a brilliant job making the game look as good as it could be.
