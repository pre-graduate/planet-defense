# String file
Thank you for downloading and playing the game.
It was made in the early parts of 2014 and is 
a major piece of my portfolio. Please note the 
game was coded from scratch it was not built 
with an advanced engine. So please dont hate it 
that much if a bug comes along. Just message me 
at wi11berto@yahoo.co.uk with any bugs you may 
have come accross and ill get them fixed. Cheers.
